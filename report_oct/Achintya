Progress report 
Project: Developing an image depth sensing algorithm and implementation on FPGA
I have been mainly focussed on learning the pre-requisites so far. 
Have gone through EPFLâ€™s coursera courses on Digital Signal Processing basics (eg. DTFT, filters). 
Also learnt Verilog basics via an NPTEL online course. 
Went through the introductory part of some research papers related to the project to gain better understanding.
