Progress in the project - Development of image depth sensing algorithm and implementation
on fpga.

This month I focused on mainly learning the pre-requisites of the project , 
Digital Signal processing using matlab basics (Things like DFFT, filters) were learnt.
Brushing up topics like verilog code reuqired for hardware implementation .
Better idea of the project was gained reading some papers related to the project.
