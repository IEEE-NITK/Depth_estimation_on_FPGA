Acquired the dataset to work with.
Looked and working on various possible method for fusion.
  1. A locally global approach to stereo correspondence with high res tof map
  2. Using maximum a posterior Markov Random Fields technique
  3. Confidence matrix using NN (will try in last)
There are few more probabilistic approach to acquire fusion and also looking at rectification of dat acquired by both methods, might go for look-up approach as easier to implement as memory.
  
Future work
Implementation and improvements of selected methods
hardware implementation of individual methods. ( Will need to design some core parts for fusion method, and can use pre-existing designs for stereo and tof individually)
